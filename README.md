# Trusting AI Agents: A Reinsurance Industry Case Study

This repository contains code for an AI assistant which helps underwriters convert messy Excel submission pack data into clean, structured catastrophe records. It parses excel submission packs, links to historical data, and produces a clean, final output. It features a multi-agent design with human-in-the-loop.
